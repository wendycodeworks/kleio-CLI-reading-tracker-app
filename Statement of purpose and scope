Statement of purpose and scope

- describe at a high level what the application will do
Reading Journal is an application designed to help users reach their reading goals and get the most
out of their books. With Reading Journal, users can keep a log of their books that they are currently 
reading, have read or would like to read. (Users can also keep track of interesting ideas they may 
come across as they read.) 

- identify the problem it will solve and explain why you are developing it
Reading Journal is dedicated to both avid readers and newly annointed bookworms, or really anyone who wants to 
retain information they derive from books. Despite the rise of online publication, books are still a fine source
for well-researched and insightful reads. Reading Journal acts as a companion for the reader-user; helping them track
reading goals (and potentially map their acquired knowledge). This application is particularly helpful for users 
who attend libraries and frequently access reference collections, where the information can only be temporarily 
accessed. 

- identify the target audience
The target audience for Reading Journal are life-long learners of any age. However, the focus will be on recreational
readers between the ages of 23-50. 

- explain how a member of the target audience will use it
A user can use this app to record all the books they have read. When Reading Journal is first opened, the user will be asked
to add some past reads as well as current reads. If a user encounters a book that they would like to read sometime in the 
future, they can add it to another list that tracks books to be read later. Users can also set a reading goal, a number of books
they would like to read in a given period of time. Reading Journal can check the number of books and provide reminders
to keep the user on track.
